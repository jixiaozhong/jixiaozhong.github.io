My research focuses on post-training of multimodal foundation models and agents.

I received my M.S. from Nanjing University, advised by <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/">Prof. Tong Lu</a>. Previously at Tencent Youtu Lab, collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3lMuodUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Xiaobin Hu</a> and <a href="https://tyshiwo.github.io/">Prof. Ying Tai</a>.
